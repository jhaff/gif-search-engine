            <def>Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is the standard markup language
            for creating web pages and web applications. With Cascading Style
            Sheets (CSS) and JavaScript, it forms a triad of cornerstone
            technologies for the World Wide Web.[4]</def>

            <p>Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from
            local storage and render the documents into multimedia web pages.
            HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and
            originally included cues for the appearance of the document.</p>
